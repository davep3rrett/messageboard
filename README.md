# messageboard
## a toy message board built with node.js

inspired by minimalistic no-login messageboards like the youth attack "jerkbooth", this board is intended to be an alternative to the oppressive and overstimulating hyperconnectedness forced on us by today's social media landscape. no tracking, no accountability, no stress, no rules, no likes, no followers, no recommendations, no notifications, no problem.

i also just did this to get more familiar with the node.js ecosystem ;~}

the app is currently live at <http://sleepy-stream-89768.herokuapp.com/>

will maybe implement photo posts in the future, although that's majorly another can of worms...

enjoy!
